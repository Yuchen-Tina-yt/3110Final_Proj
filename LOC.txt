Dear player, Welcome to the Lord of Feuds! The game consists lots of commands and should be self-explanatory in nature. To help you have a more enjoyable experience, we have summarized the rules of game here.


The game consists of four players. 

Each player is given $1000 at the start of the game. They can exchange USD to other currencies for free.

At every player’s turn, the dice is automatically rolled and the player will land in a country based on the result of the dice. The board is wrap-around meaning that if the player reaches the last spot, they will be taken to the first spot. 

When a player lands in a new place that is not bought by any player , the player has the following 6 options:

Enter purchase to purchase the place if he has enough money
Enter develop to develop the place if he has enough money
Enter command “money” to check your what amount of money you have in each currency
Enter “quit” to surrender
Enter “end” to end your turn 
Enter “chance” to see your chance cards 
Enter “use free land” to use your chance card 
Enter” buy_weapon” to buy a weapon 





When a player lands in a place owned by another player, he/she will be facing a rent charge. The player has the following 3 options:
Enter “rent” to pay rent
Enter “battle” to fight the owner. If the player wins, he/she would become the new owner of the land. 
Enter “quit” to surrender



The game also features a lottery system which adds to the excitement of the game. At every turn, a player is randomly selected to enter in a lottery system. If the player is selected into the lottery, he/she will be facing three possible results of the lottery:
Win some money
Lose some money
Get a chance card that gives the player the ownership of a free land



Losing conditions: A player loses if he or she
Quit the game
Bankrupt as the player runs out of money 


Winning conditions: The player who lasts until the end wins.
