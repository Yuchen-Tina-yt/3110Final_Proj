# Lord of Feuds Game

The game supports multi-player, and it allows players to purchase land & weapons. Players could earn profit like what they can do in the traditional Monopoly game, but more than that-- \n
you, the great landlord, can fight against other landlords using the weapons you purchased. And, if you win, you get the land for free!
Also--try our fancy lottery system! In addition to having the chance card system, we also have a randomized lottery system that could give you advantages, or, give you a "real surprise". Are you lucky enough?
