For MS1, our system contains the basic static modules for our game. To install and build our system, you just need to have all the files(modules) downloaded on your computer and then run make build.(we have the .merlin and .ocamlinit file in the project, and I can see them in the VScode. I'm not sure why I cannot see it in the project folder, but I'm sure they are there.) Since we will build our game engine in the next milestone, for now you can interact with our system using utop, by running the functions defined in the modules. For example, you can first call the constructor function in our Player module to create a new player, and you can then call the other functions to let the player perform certain tasks, like take item or drop item. Similar thing could be done for the other modules.
